# Linux Mint on Matebook D 14 2018

This is a short guide on how to correctly configure Linux Mint 20.1 Ulyssa on Matebook D 14 2018 (Ryzen 5 2500U).

## Deprecation notice

⚠️ This guide is outdated, I no longer use Linux Mint on my Matebook but use Fedora (36 and soon 37).

Fedora works fine, but sometimes it suddenly freezes [AMD Ryzen Bug?]([AMD Ryzen &quot;Freezing&quot; Bug on GNU/Linux Systems · GitHub](https://gist.github.com/dlqqq/876d74d030f80dc899fc58a244b72df0)).

The touchpad works fine if you do not use suspend to RAM.

## Update the kernel

After installation I raccomend you to install the latest 5.8 kernel available.

I currently run version `5.8.0-41-generic`

## Fixing boot warnings

During boot you get the following messages, you can also view them by running `sudo dmesg --level=err`

- AMD-Vi: [Firmware Bug]: : IOAPIC[4] not in IVRS table

- AMD-Vi: [Firmware Bug]: : IOAPIC[5] not in IVRS table

- AMD-Vi: [Firmware Bug]: : No southbridge IOAPIC found

- AMD-Vi: Disabling interrupt remapping

- AMD-Vi: Unable to read/write to IOMMU perf counter.

- snd_pci_acp3x 0000:02:00.5: Invalid ACP audio mode : 1

To fix some of these errors, just add the following string to `/etc/default/grub` file

`ivrs_ioapic[4]=00:14.0 ivrs_ioapic[5]=00:00.2`

Before making any changes is a good thing to backup the file, you can do that with the following commands:

1. `cd /etc/default/grub`

2. `cp grub grub.orig` (this command make a copy of the configuration file)

Then add the string above in `GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT` before `quiet splash` keyword.

The full line should be like this:

`GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT="ivrs_ioapic[4]=00:14.0 ivrs_ioapic[5]=00:00.2 quiet splash"`

After doing that, run `sudo update-grub` for the changes to take effect.

Reboot the system, now four warnings are fixed.

## Known issues

### Touchpad

Sometimes the touchpad stops working, especially after suspend.

The error is the following:

- `i2c_hid i2c-ELAN2203:00: i2c_hid_get_input: IRQ triggered but there's no data`

A possibile workaround to this issue is this command that should restart the touchpad driver. [Source](https://www.reddit.com/r/Ubuntu/comments/fwiuf4/my_huawei_matebook_freezes/fmp5076?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)

`sudo rmmod i2c_hid && sudo modprobe i2c_hid`

## Benchmarks

I did a benchmark with Geekbench 5 and these are the results:

- Single-Core: 930

- Multi-Core: 3044

Not bad, right?
